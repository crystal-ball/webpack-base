/*
 * InspireScript Project Styles Entry
 * The application styles for InspireScript should be driven as much as possible by
 * a common set of theme variables and classes. Components consumed by the project
 * that follow this pattern will match the appearance of the application as a whole.
 */

/*
 * Variables Setup
 * The same set of theme variables should be used for theming Bootstrap and
 * application components, see `theme.scss` for details. Note that the webpack build
 * is configured so that the theme variables can be imported into any component
 * style file with: `@import 'theme';` This makes it easy to use the same theme
 * variables everywhere.
