## Webpack Configurations
Webpack configuration changes can be made in `webpack.config.js`. The
[`@inspire-script/webpack-configs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inspire-script/webpack-configs)
package creates a base Webpack configuration that will work with the conventional
InspireScript project tools. See the [Webpack Guide](/guides/tools/Webpack.md) for
details.
