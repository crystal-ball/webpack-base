# Project Application
InspireScript strives to utilize small libraries to create discreet application
concerns. This is important for flexibility over time. Small libraries that are
concise in their concerns are easier to refactor or replace.

#### Application stack
- [React][]
- [React Router][]
- [Redux][] _(with [React Redux][] for binding)_
- [Redux Saga][]
- [Bootstrap v4][] _(with [classnames][])_
- [Nanoid][]
- [Componentry][]

## Application Conventions
InspireScript favors simplicity over cleverness and encourages direct, explicit
code.

## Styles and Theming
InspireScript projects use a powerful styling system to create highly customizable
applications. See [Styles][] for details.
